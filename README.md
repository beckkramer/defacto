# defacto
A tiny Sass/CSS setup that aggressively defers to browser defaults.

## Why?
I wanted to see how much CSS I could *not* write and still get a
pleasant looking page that still feels "designed." A big goal was 
staying out of the way of all the things browsers do a great job
of before we override everything (eg. clear focus on keyboard
navigation, relative font sizing and spacing, etc).

## Well, what does it do?
Not much! Basically accepts a couple variables and outputs some 
simple CSS. If you've been looking for a barebones bit of CSS for
a simple text-heavy display, this could be a nice fit.

## I want to override things more!
Awesome, go for it! This is super basic, so rock out.
